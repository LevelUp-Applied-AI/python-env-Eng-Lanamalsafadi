# AI.SPIRE Pre-Work — Python Toolchain

This repository is your workspace for Pre-Work Days 3–5.

| Day | PR | Topic |
|-----|-----|-------|

| 4 | PR-3 | Notebook vs Script: Same Output Two Ways |
| 5 | PR-4 | Compute & Debug Evidence Pack |

## Setup

Install Python 3.11 from [python.org](https://python.org), then:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
# source .venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows (Git Bash)
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements-prework.txt
```

## Submitting PRs

1. Create a branch named for the PR task (e.g., `pr-02-python-env`)
2. Complete the work
3. Push the branch and open a PR from your branch to `main`
4. Submit the PR URL in TalentLMS

## When to use each

- **Jupyter Notebook:** Ideal for interactive data exploration, experimenting with code step by step, and creating reports that combine text, visuals, and results. It allows quick understanding of outcomes and easy sharing with others.  
- **Python Script (.py):** Best for code that will run regularly, such as automated tasks or within a production environment. It enables clean code organization, testing support, and reusability as a module in other projects.
